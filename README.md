# Simple Calendar App
_Link to hosting webpage:_ <https://omata48.github.io/HW5/>

The main function of this app is being able to create a Web Page that utilizes data from an external API (moment) in order to create its elements. By working with a simple calendar, I was able to modify the time that is being tracked and it reflecting the current day.

## Layout

The layout was mostly provided with the code included. By correctly referencing and defining classess, coinciding with the appropriate CSS elements, the challenge was recreating the framework for the app. The layout was a grid made up of rows and 3 sub columns that are styled to best display their information: time, text data, and a save button. The elements are generated using Bootstrap which allows them to dynamically stretch to fill different dispaly sizes.

For this calendar, the user required only the time periods between 9 am - 5 pm, however this could easily be expanded or narrowed by changing the amount of blocks created. For my calendar, I hardcoded the [div.time-block]s but this could be translated to elements generated by jQuery if the hours need to be more dynamic.

## Function

The main function of the application is to track the time of day and display this to the user with color showing past, present, and future timeblocks as different colors. The users interactions with the application is being able to enter text into the textarea element and when "clicking" on the button, the input on the text area is saved localy with the key being the "index-row" value of the parent element of the textarea.  

In this iteration, the local storage would at max hold 9 different values with 9 different keys. However, this could be condensed to only utilize one key if memory becomes an issue with other versions. An init function calls on any locally stored values to allow users to save and refresh the page without loosing information.
